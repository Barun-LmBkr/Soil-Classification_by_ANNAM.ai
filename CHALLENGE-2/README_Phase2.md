##  Problem Statement

In **Phase 2**, the task is to develop a **binary classification model** that determines whether a given image contains soil (`label = 1`) or not (`label = 0`). Only **positive labeled samples (soil)** are provided in the training set, making this an **anomaly detection** problem.

---

##  Solution Overview

We use a **One-Class SVM** model trained only on soil images. To make this effective:

###  Feature Extraction:
- We extract features using two pre-trained convolutional neural networks:
  - **ResNet50**
  - **VGG16**
- Both models are used **without the top classification layer** and their outputs are concatenated to form rich visual representations.

###  Model Training:
- We fit a **One-Class SVM** on the training features (all soil images).
- A conservative `nu` value is used (`nu=0.01`) to strictly classify only similar images as soil.

###  Prediction:
- During inference, features from test images are extracted using the same pipeline.
- The One-Class SVM predicts if the test image is similar to soil images (`label = 1`) or not (`label = 0`).

##  Evaluation Metric

- **F1-Score** (on test set)
- Our approach aims for **high precision** by being conservative in classifying an image as soil.

---

##  Visualizations

- We include histograms and box plots of **decision scores** to understand model confidence.
- These are saved in `decision_scores_analysis.png`.

---

##  Final Notes

- The entire solution is designed with **modularity** and **reproducibility** in mind.
- Feature extraction, model training, and inference are clearly separated for easy debugging and scaling.
