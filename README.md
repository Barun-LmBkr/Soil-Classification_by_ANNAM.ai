##  Project Overview

This repository contains our solutions for both **Phase 1 (Multiclass classification)** and **Phase 2 (Binary anomaly detection)** of the **Soil Image Classification Challenge**. Each phase is organized in its own folder:

```
ANNAM.ai/
â”œâ”€â”€ CHALLENGE-1/    # Phase 1 - Soil Type Classification
â””â”€â”€ CHALLENGE-2/    # Phase 2 - Soil vs Non-Soil Detection
```

---

##  Phase 1: Soil Type Classification (Multiclass)

###  Task  
Classify soil images into one of four types:  
**Alluvial**, **Black**, **Clay**, or **Red**

###  Evaluation  
**Minimum per-class F1 score**  
(using `average=None` in `sklearn.metrics.f1_score`)

###  Structure (`CHALLENGE-1/`)
| File               | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `preprocessing.py` | Load CSVs, encode labels, define dataset class |
| `training.ipynb`   | Train Swin Transformer using `timm` |
| `inference.ipynb`  | Generate predictions using best model |
| `postprocessing.py`| Post-processing and analysis |
| `best_model.pth`   | Saved best model |
| `label_encoder.pkl`| Label encoder for decoding |
| `submission.csv`   | Final predictions |

###  Model  
- **Swin Transformer** (`swin_base_patch4_window7_224`)
- Weighted loss + Stratified split

---

##  Phase 2: Soil vs Non-Soil Classification (Binary)

###  Task  
Identify if a test image is a **soil image (1)** or **not (0)**.  
This is framed as an **anomaly detection** problem since **only positive (soil) examples** are provided for training.

###  Evaluation  
**F1-Score**

###  Structure (`CHALLENGE-2/`)
| File               | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `preprocessing.py` | Feature extraction using ResNet50 & VGG16 |
| `training.ipynb`   | Train One-Class SVM on soil features |
| `inference.ipynb`  | Test on unknown images using trained model |
| `postprocessing.py`| Format predictions into submission file |
| `decision_scores_analysis.png` | Decision score distribution visualization |

###  Model  
- **Feature Extractors**: ResNet50 + VGG16 (ImageNet-pretrained)
- **Anomaly Detector**: One-Class SVM (`nu=0.01`)

##  Setup Instructions

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision timm pandas scikit-learn opencv-python tensorflow
```

##  How to Run

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Soil Type Classification

1. **Preprocess & Load Data**  
   Run `preprocessing.py` to prepare data and label encoding.

2. **Train Model**  
   Open `training.ipynb` and train the Swin Transformer. The best model will be saved as `best_model.pth`.

3. **Inference**  
   Use `inference.ipynb` to generate predictions on test data.

4. **Post-process**  
   Run `postprocessing.py` to convert predictions into final submission format.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Soil vs Non-Soil Detection

1. **Feature Extraction**  
   Run `preprocessing.py` to extract features using ResNet50 and VGG16.

2. **Train One-Class SVM**  
   Open `training.ipynb` and fit the model on soil features only.

3. **Inference**  
   Use `inference.ipynb` to make predictions on test features.

4. **Post-process**  
   Run `postprocessing.py` to generate the binary classification submission file.
